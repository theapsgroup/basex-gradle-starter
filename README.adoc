A simple build script template for using http://basex.org[BaseX] from a
https://gradle.org[Gradle] buildscript (also adds Saxon HE).

This is for BaseX version {basexVersion} if you want to test with a different version then
choose one of the other branches.

Installation steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/xokomola/basex-gradle-starter.git`
2. There is no step 2

That's right. There's just one step between cloning this and using this.

== Usage

This build script provides the following tasks for running BaseX.

- `gui`
- `client`
- `http`

Configuration is done in `gradle.properties`.

.BaseX HTTP server
[source]
----
gradlew http
----

.BaseX client console
[source]
----
gradlew http
----

.BaseX GUI

----
gradlew gui

== Using a standalone JAR

You can combine all the needed jar files and create a so-called fat JAR. This
allows you to run BaseX as a JAR (easy to deploy). You can already do that
with the BaseX core distribution but with this it also includes the optional
libraries.

.Build fat JAR
[source]
----
gradlew shadowJar
----

The JAR file will be created in the `build/libs` directory.

Note that you will still have to deploy the `data`, `repo` and `webapp`
directories (and other resources) separately.

.HTTP server
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
java -Dorg.basex.dbpath=data \
     -Dorg.basex.repopath=repo \ 
     -Dorg.basex.webpath=webapp \
     -jar build/libs/{shadowJarName}
----

You can also use all the regular basex
http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Command-Line_Options[command-line arguments]. For
example start the HTTP server on a different port.

.BaseX client console
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
java -Dorg.basex.dbpath=data \
     -Dorg.basex.repopath=repo \ 
     -Dorg.basex.webpath=webapp \
     -cp build/libs/{shadowJarName} \
     org.basex.BaseXClient
----

.BaseX GUI
[source,subs="attributes"]
----
java -Dorg.basex.dbpath=data \
     -Dorg.basex.repopath=repo \ 
     -Dorg.basex.webpath=webapp \
     -cp build/libs/{shadowJarName} \
     org.basex.BaseXGUI
